# here we are using a 2 pointer approach where i and j are the pointer
# i will find the last unique number and j will traverse all the elements
# if the elements at position i and j are equal then i just gets incremented
# if they are not equal then a unique element in found 
# finally we are returning the number of unique elements in the nums arrray
